# "PolitiFight" Project

A place where people from different sides of the isle can come together and debate their sides.

## Requirements

* There will be a way to create an account or play anonymously.

* There will be multiple different topics to discuss, each with different sides that can be joined.

* There will be multiple game modes, and every topic will be able to be discussed in these modes.

* Every game mode will be, at its core, a basic chat room between two or more people.

* There will be a currency type.
  
  * The currency will be used to customize a person's profile, send emojis in the chat, amongst other things.
  * The currency can be obtained by playing the game
  * The currency will also be obtainable by spending real money
  * A maximum currency amount will be awarded at the end of every match, but will decrease if insults, language, or other illegal behaviour is detected.

* There will be an automated Referee
  
  * This Referee will scan every message for illegal behaviour such as insults, slander, language, or other indescent behaviour.
  * If an offense is detected, then the person will be penalized by not recieving the max amount of currency at the end of the match.

* There will be profile statistics that could include
  
  * A person's most played game mode
  
  * A person's typical political standing (left, right, center, etc.)
  
  * A person's total number of wins in the 'Jury' mode

## Game Modes

Most Game Modes will be refereed by the Referee, and each game mode will have a 1v1 and a 2v2 variation.

**Required Game Modes**:

* 'Battle Royal'
  
  * A basic chatroom with no turns and a timer.

* 'Debate'
  
  * A chatroom where each participant will take turns sending a message to the other. There will be a time limit on how long the person has to create his or her message.
  
  * There will be a timer.

*  'Jury'
  
  * A 'Debate' style chatroom that is spectated by other players, and a winner is selected by those spectators at the end of the match. The winner gains extra currency and the win is recorded in the person's profile statistics.
  
  * The spectaters will be an even mix between those of different sides.

**Potential Game Modes**

* 'Fight Room'
  
  * A chat room where there will be no time limit, no turns, no referee, and no reward at the end.
  
  * Player's will be given a warning/disclaimer before entering this game mode.
  
  * Player's will still select a topic and side before entering this mode. In other words, this isn't just a basic chatroom for people to chill-out in.

## Future/Desired Features

* 3v3 variation for game modes

* Seasonal challenges

* "Topic of the Week" that is based on recent events in the news.
