# Backlog

* Little brother also made it into a chatroom after leaving ours... I don't think anyone else was online. He clicked "ok" to leave our chatroom after I left, but then got put back into a chatroom.

* Put topic and side at the top of chat room.

* reCaptcha for SignUp page (needs a custom domain first so Politick can be registered with Google Search Console)

* Verify ALL purchases on the backend (avatars and word packs)

* More avatars and avatar types (common, rare, epic, and legendary)

* Mystery boxes (maybe) (coin mystery box??)

* Make existing theme more colorful

* Make chatroom scroll down as far as the height of the new message

* Maybe display a small player card below the most recent text (or some other way of displaying the other card)

* set the theme of the app to the player's preference when they login

* Find out how to limit certain properties from getting sent when obtaining player data after logging in.

* Better sign-up experience, where you are presented with
  
  * a page to choose your avatar
  
  * a page to choose your title
  
  with explanations for each before you're sent to the dashboard.

* Card backgrounds (could just be colors for now)
