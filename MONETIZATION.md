# Monetization

There will be two primary means of making money off of this application;

* Players spending money for coins

* Advertising

Advertising will be relatively straight-forward, with an ad being placed at the bottom of the screen of the 'internal' application, and at the top of the screen in a chat room.

However, the game's economy must be well thought out to maximise profit while also helping players feel like they don't have to spend money to get nice things. That being said, this means that it will be entirely possible and plausible to gain enough coins to buy the things that they want *without spending money*.

If players earn 5 coins per match, and every match is 5 minutes, then players can gain no more than 60 coins per hour. That is what we are paying players to play the game. Coins, in relation to actual money, will be priced at 10 cents per coin. This means that we are paying players \$6 per hour to play the game.

Coins will be buyable in the following amounts:

* 100 coins for \$10

* 50 coins for \$5

* 20 coins for \$2

We also want to have as much buyable content as possible, so that players feel the need to obtain as many coins as possible. This will hopefully drive those players who are willing to buy coins with actual money.

### Buyable Content

At first, I was thinking of there being avatars and backgrounds... but this has proven to be kind of beyond my abilities at the moment. So I think there will be two main elements of a player's account that they will be able to customize:

* their avatar

* their title

Obviousley, avatars are pretty straight forward. They will be cool, politically neutral images that a player can use to represent themselves. There will be a base avatar that everyone gets at account creation, and then they can purchase more to use.

Titles, however, will be a bit more interesting. Similar to usernames, these titles will describe the player. However, they will not be required to be unique and they will consist of an adjective and a verb or noun, such as

* Happy Lover

* Crazy Runner

* Destructive Tank

* Purple Dragon

* Angelic Axe

These will let the player further represent themselves. However, these words will not be individually purchasable due to the number and variety of them. I think it would be more effective to devide them into two groups, the descriptor and the descriptee. Then, the only way to obtain these would be via mystery boxes, with different boxes for different kinds of words, each varying in rarity.
