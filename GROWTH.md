# Growth Strategy

## Social Media

I need to get more people on the game as fast as possible. I will do this with a 

- FaceBook page

- Instagram page

Regular posts for user engagement.

- 3 'engagement' posts a week - Monday, Wednesday, Friday: A minimal post about some recent political event.

- 1 'loyalty' post a week - Saturday: A more blog-style post, a personal take on a political event, topic, or other relevant things.

For EVERY post, I need to have a photo or video for increased engagement, as well as relevant hashtags (hashtags typically increase reach/engagement by 4.4%(acording to Facebook)). If I have any links, **put them into the comments section**. Facebook supresses posts that send users elsewhere, so I need to put any links that I want to share into the comments section.

To do:

- Make a Politick account on X

- Make regular Facebook stories/reels posts.

## Advertising

Occasionally I will boost a Facebook page.

I also plan on creating an ad and putting that on Facebook and Instagram.
