# Monetization

There will be two primary means of making money off of this application;

* Players spending money for coins

* Advertising

Advertising will be relatively straight-forward, with an ad being placed at the bottom of the screen of the 'internal' application, and at the top of the screen in a chat room.

However, the game's economy must be well thought out to maximise profit while also helping players feel like they don't have to spend money to get nice things. That being said, this means that it will be entirely possible and plausible to gain enough coins to buy the things that they want *without spending money*.

If players earn 5 coins per match, and every match is 5 minutes, then players can gain no more than 60 coins per hour. That is what we are paying players to play the game. Coins, in relation to actual money, will be priced at 10 cents per coin. This means that we are paying players \$6 per hour to play the game.

Coins will be buyable in the following amounts:

* 100 coins for \$10

* 50 coins for \$5

* 20 coins for \$2

We also want to have as much buyable content as possible, so that players feel the need to obtain as many coins as possible. This will hopefully drive those players who are willing to buy coins with actual money.
